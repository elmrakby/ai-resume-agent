Build a production-ready multi-page web app for “AI Resume & Career Agent” using Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, and Radix UI. Include responsive, accessible, SEO-optimized pages and modern animations.

Core goals:
- Marketing site + gated dashboard.
- Payments: Stripe (USD for international) and Paymob (EGP for Egypt) with auto geo-detection + manual switch.
- Auth: Email/Google via Clerk (or NextAuth if simpler). Public marketing pages, protected /dashboard.
- Intake form with file upload (CV PDF/DOCX up to 10MB) and job ad text/URL; store files via UploadThing (or Supabase Storage).
- Orders DB + webhook handlers (Stripe, Paymob) to mark payments as PAID.

Pages & routes:
- /               → Hero, How It Works (3 steps), Packages (3 cards), Why Choose Us, Testimonials, FAQ, Closing CTA.
- /pricing        → Detailed pricing table + “Choose plan” buttons.
- /checkout?plan=basic|standard|premium → Auto select gateway by country (EG→Paymob, else→Stripe) with manual toggle.
- /order/success  → Thank you + Start Submission button → /dashboard/new-submission.
- /order/cancel   → Retry payment page.
- /dashboard      → Requires login. Shows orders, submissions, statuses.
- /dashboard/new-submission → Intake form (file upload + fields).
- /api/geo        → Return { countryCode, inferredGateway } by IP (edge runtime; fallback “stripe”).
- /api/stripe/checkout, /api/stripe/webhook
- /api/paymob/checkout, /api/paymob/webhook
- /privacy, /terms, /sitemap.xml, /robots.txt

Data model (Prisma + Postgres or Supabase):
- users: id, email, name, createdAt
- orders: id, userId, plan (BASIC|STANDARD|PREMIUM), amount, currency (USD|EGP), gateway (STRIPE|PAYMOB), status (PENDING|PAID|FAILED|CANCELED), externalId, countryCode, ip, createdAt
- submissions: id, userId, orderId, roleTarget, industry, language (EN|AR|BOTH), jobAdUrl, jobAdText, notes, cvFileUrl, coverLetterFileUrl, status (NEW|IN_PROGRESS|QA|DELIVERED), createdAt

Intake form (Zod validation):
- roleTarget (required), industry (optional), language (enum EN/AR/BOTH), jobAdUrl OR jobAdText (require at least one), notes (optional)
- cvFile (required; pdf|doc|docx, ≤10MB), coverLetterFile (optional same constraints)
- On submit → create submission row + upload files to UploadThing path submissions/{userId}/{submissionId}/

Payments & routing:
- /checkout loads plan, calls /api/geo to guess gateway.
- If countryCode == "EG" → default Paymob (EGP). Else → Stripe (USD).
- Show manual switch component to override gateway (Stripe ↔ Paymob).
- Stripe: Checkout Session with three price IDs (env: STRIPE_PRICE_BASIC_USD, STRIPE_PRICE_STANDARD_USD, STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM_USD). Webhook (checkout.session.completed) sets order.status=PAID.
- Paymob: Implement auth token → order → payment key → iframe URL using env PAYMOB_*; webhook verifies HMAC, sets order.status=PAID.
- Create order row before redirect; update externalId after session/order creation.

Auth:
- Clerk preferred (email + Google). If not logged in on /checkout, prompt login then return to chosen plan. Protect /dashboard and /dashboard/new-submission.

Design / Look & Feel (Apple-like modern):
- Visual tone: ultra-clean, high contrast, generous white space, large elegant typography, precise spacing. Avoid clutter.
- Color palette: primary blue #1E73BE, surfaces white #FFFFFF, accents green #34A853 for success; subtle neutrals for text (#0E1111 / #475569). Support dark mode via media query, with tasteful neutrals.
- Components: shadcn/ui cards, buttons (rounded-xl), inputs with clear focus rings. Use iconography (Lucide) sparingly and purposefully.
- Motion & microinteractions (Framer Motion):
  • Page transitions: fade + slight scale (duration 0.35s, ease “easeOut”), persistent navbar.
  • Section reveals on scroll: 20–40px upward translate + fade in (staggered children).
  • Buttons: subtle hover lift + shadow; pressed state scale 0.98.
  • Pricing toggle highlight with spring.
  • Smooth scroll for in-page anchors.
- Hero: full-bleed, text-led, crisp headline and subheadline, one primary CTA, one secondary ghost button. Optional gentle gradient overlay; no heavy stock photos.
- How It Works: 3-step horizontal on desktop, stacked on mobile; each card animates on view.
- Packages: 3 cards with soft shadows; “Standard” marked as Most Popular (accent ring). Include price, features, CTA.
- Testimonials: 3 quote cards with circular avatar placeholders and subtle background tint.
- FAQ: accordion with smooth height animation; clear affordance.
- Navbar: sticky, slight blur/glass on scroll, active link indicator; footer minimal with privacy/terms links.
- Typography: Inter or SF-like system font; large hero H1 (~48–64 on desktop) and balanced line height.
- Accessibility: color contrast AA+, focus outlines, aria labels, reduced motion respect.

Content (copy placeholders):
- Hero H1: “Land Your Next Job with a Resume That Gets Noticed”
- Sub: “ATS-optimized resumes, LinkedIn rewrites, and tailored cover letters — delivered in 48 hours. English & Arabic.”
- CTAs: “Get My Resume”, “See Pricing”
- How It Works steps: Upload CV + Job Ad → AI + Expert Polish → Delivery in 48h
- Packages: Basic (Resume), Standard (Resume + LinkedIn + 1 Cover Letter + 1 Revision), Premium (2 Resumes, LinkedIn, Multiple Cover Letters, Mock Interview Q&A, 1-week Support, 72h Priority)
- Why Choose Us bullets: MENA-focused; Bilingual (EN/AR); 48h turnaround; ATS-optimized; Affordable
- FAQ items: ATS compatibility; Arabic resumes; revisions; payment options; difference vs free tools

Geo & wallets:
- Add client-side detection for Apple Pay/Google Pay capability with Stripe.js (Payment Request API). If available and gateway=Stripe, show wallet buttons above card button; fallback to card.
- Always keep manual gateway switch visible.

Env & setup:
- .env.example keys: CLERK (or NEXTAUTH), STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PRICE_* IDs, PAYMOB_API_KEY, PAYMOB_INTEGRATION_ID_CARD, PAYMOB_IFRAME_ID, PAYMOB_HMAC, DATABASE_URL, UPLOADTHING_SECRET/APP_ID, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.
- Include a README with setup steps (Stripe products + webhook, Paymob HMAC, DB migrate, UploadThing setup, Clerk).
- Add dev “test mode” toggles for Stripe/Paymob sandbox; log webhooks only in dev.

Quality:
- Zod schemas on all API routes; proper error handling and toasts.
- TypeScript strict; no any.
- SEO: metadata, Open Graph, sitemap, robots.
- i18n: simple EN/AR toggle; apply RTL when AR selected (dir="rtl"), mirror layout appropriately.

Deliver:
- A runnable Next.js app with above routes, components, and stubs wired, including minimal unit examples where helpful. Provide mock data where real keys are absent so pages render.
